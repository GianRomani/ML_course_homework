# ML_course_homeworks  
Code and reports of the two homeworks for Machine Learning course (Winter 2020)  
  HW1) Classification of programs starting from their assembly code (it was forbidden to use any Deep Learning approach). The assigned dataset had lots of duplicates, so I decided it could be interesting to compare the results of the training on both datasets.   
  HW2) Classification of domestic objects using neural networks.
